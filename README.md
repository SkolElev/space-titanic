# Space Titanic
A simple school project written in Java about spaceships shooting asteroids and other people...

This project is currently ongoing and is not indicative of the final game.

# Prerequisites
IntelliJ IDEA.

openJDK version 21 (can be installed through the IDE). 

However Netbeans and other IDEs also work just fine.

# Our Goal
Well, our project is about creating a multiplayer game. Whether we succeed or fail in achieving our goal depends on us.
